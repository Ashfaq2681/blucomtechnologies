                humans have an innate desire to belong, to align with the tribe.
                When we see others endorsing a product, it reduces our perceived risk, creating a sense of trust
                and credibility. This is why 93% of consumers report that online reviews influence their purchasing

                However, a word of caution authenticity reigns supreme. Fabricated reviews or
